"STOCK MARKET VARIATION PREDICTION USING REDDIT WORLDNEWS: IMPLEMENTATION OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM AND PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION"

In this project, we developed a machine learning algorithm to predict stock market changes based on 25 good news stories from Reddit WorldNews. Our goal is to create a binary classification model that can predict market rises or falls with at least 85% accuracy. Through experimentation and optimization, we managed to achieve an accuracy of 87.6%, exceeding the initial target.
Comparative analysis also shows significant improvements compared to models using CountVectorizer. For further development, we plan to increase accuracy to more than 90% by focusing on precision and recall algorithms. The application of more complex models such as artificial neural networks is also a consideration to improve stock market prediction performance. Thus, this project not only contributes to investment decision making, but also offers a foundation for further research in the field of financial market analysis using machine learning.

In one project, research is needed to develop a machine learning algorithm that can predict stock market variations based on daily news from Reddit WorldNews. In this context, an in-depth understanding of the factors that influence stock market movements is needed as well as the application of machine learning technology to produce accurate predictions.

The following objectives of this project will be defined:
Developed a machine learning model that functions as a binary classification model, focusing on predicting stock market increases or decreases.
Ensure that the developed model has an accuracy rate that exceeds 85%, thereby providing strong confidence in the prediction results.
